No rocket-science, this-will-change-the-face-of-open-source repo. 

Just trying to give you ideas to get rid of your boredom or for free time or those days when you dont feel like working *(everyday?)*

* Make repos like this?
* Read a book relevant to your work. :books:
* Talk to another bored/free team member - sometimes this leads to great knowledge sharing! :speech_balloon:
* Read [hacker news] (https://news.ycombinator.com/). :newspaper:
* Read/write blogs, inspirations.
* Find people on various sites to follow - [Quora](https://quora.com), [Github Explore] (https://github.com/explore), [Medium](https://medium.com) :eyeglasses:
* Learn something new - A new tech everytime you are free works really well! [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) is my fav!
* Network with people from other teams and departments.
