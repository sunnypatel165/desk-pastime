List of things you can do while sitting at your office desk. 

No rocket-science, this-will-change-the-face-of-open-source repo. 

Just trying to give you ideas to get rid of your boredom or for free time or those days when you dont feel like working *(everyday?)*

* Make repos like this?
* Read a book relevant to your work.
* Talk to another bored/free team member - sometimes this leads to great knowledge sharing!
* Read [hacker news] (https://news.ycombinator.com/).
* Read blogs, inspirations.
* Find people on various sites to follow - [Quora](https://quora.com), [github explore] (https://github.com/explore], [Medium](https://medium.com)
* Learn something new - A new tech everytime you are free works really well! [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) is my fav!
* Network with people with other teams and departments.
